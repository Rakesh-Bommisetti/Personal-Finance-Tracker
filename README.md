# Personal-Finance-Tracker
You can open the "index.html" file in your web browser, and it will display the personal finance tracker. Users can add income or expense transactions using the "Type" drop-down, they can add the transaction using the "Add Transaction" button. They can edit the transactions, and delete transactions. The transactions and current balance will be updated and displayed dynamically on the page.
